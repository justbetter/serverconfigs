# Description:
# enabled - feature flag.
# if enabled is false, the allowlisting feature is removed.
# This is like removing the check that checks if an API is allowlisted.
# This is equivalent to continuing with the usual access control checks, and removing all the code that implements allowlisting.
# if enabled is true, then all users except SuperAdmin can access only the APIs in requests
# SuperAdmin can access all APIs.
# SuperAdmin is defined by the SuperAdmin certificate, which is configured in the opensearch.yml setting: plugins.security.authcz.admin_dn:
# Refer to the example setting in opensearch.yml.example, and the opendistro documentation to know more about configuring SuperAdmin.
#
# requests - map of allowlisted endpoints, and the allowlisted HTTP requests for those endpoints
config:
  enabled: false
