# Description:
# enabled - feature flag.
# if enabled is false, the whitelisting feature is removed.
# This is like removing the check that checks if an API is whitelisted.
# This is equivalent to continuing with the usual access control checks, and removing all the code that implements whitelisting.
# if enabled is true, then all users except SuperAdmin can access only the APIs in requests
# SuperAdmin can access all APIs.
# SuperAdmin is defined by the SuperAdmin certificate, which is configured in the opensearch.yml setting: plugins.security.authcz.admin_dn:
# Refer to the example setting in opensearch.yml.example, and the opendistro documentation to know more about configuring SuperAdmin.
#
# requests - map of whitelisted endpoints, and the whitelisted HTTP requests for those endpoints

# Examples showing how to configure this yml file (make sure the _meta data from above is also there):
# Example 1:
# To enable whitelisting and whitelist GET /_cluster/settings
